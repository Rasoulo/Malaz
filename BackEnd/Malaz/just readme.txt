  The current code is excellent, but if you want to make your project "professional":  
  - Wrap complex operations with transactions.  
  - Use Resource Classes for the responses.  
  - Add Authorization for the show if the property is private.  
  - Consider SoftDeletes to preserve the data.  
  - Maintain a unified response format across all endpoints.
