# What's Global Widgets Directory?

- The `global widgets` directory contains reusable widgets that are shared across multiple screens.

## - How it works?
This directory can contain anything from simple custom buttons and text fields to more complex composite widgets. 

* **Why is that?**
By creating a library of reusable widgets, we can ensure a consistent look and feel across the application and avoid code duplication. It makes the UI development faster and more efficient.
